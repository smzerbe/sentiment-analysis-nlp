# sentiment-analysis-nlp

This project builds a neural network model for sentiment classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained on pre-labeled review datasets from Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB to predict whether a given review expresses positive or negative sentiment.

## Project Overview

- Goal: Automatically classify review text as positive or negative
- Model: Feedforward Neural Network built using `Keras` and `TensorFlow`
- Data: Labeled sentiment data from three sources: Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Vectorization and embedding
- Neural network model construction using Keras
- Training/validation and accuracy tracking
- Evaluation on unseen review data
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `sklearn`
